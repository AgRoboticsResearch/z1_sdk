The z1_sdk is mainly used for communication between z1_controller and command panel(keyboard, joystick, user control panel etc).

## Notice

support robot: Z1(v3.6.1)

## Example

There are three examples of command panel control based on SDK in this project, you can use it fllowing the steps below.

### State change

- First, set(CTRL_PANEL SDK)  # z1_ws/src/z1_controller/CMakeList.txtï¼Œand then rebuild the z1_ws to generate z1_ctrl, then open a teminal to run z1_ctrl

  ```
  cd /<path to>/z1_controller/build
  sudo ./z1_ctrl
  ```

- Sencond, build the z1_sdk, and then open another terminal to run example.

  ```
  cd /<path to>/z1_sdk && mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j4
  ./example_state_send
  ```

### Low level control

```
sudo ./z1_ctrl			# Running in a terminal
./example_lowCmd_send	# Running in another terminal
```

### Keyboard control

```
sudo ./z1_ctrl				# Running in a terminal
./example_keyboard_send		# Running in another terminal
```
